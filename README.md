# ToTheStars
Requires [MixinBooter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-booter "MixinBooter") (8.0 or higher does not work, for now use 7.1)

A patch that allows stars to be associated with worlds. In other words, you can go to stars. Does not include stars themselves, must be added separately.  [HaveASolTime](https://github.com/Codetoil/haveasoltime "HaveASolTime Github") gives an example for using the api.

Available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tothestars "ToTheStars CurseForge") and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/tothestars "ToTheStars Modrinth")
